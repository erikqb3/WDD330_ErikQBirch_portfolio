  <h1>Week  Notes</h1>
  <h2>Notes from Readings</h2>
  <ul>
    <h4>Chapter 5 Notes</h4>
    <li>There are lots of ways to create objects.</li>
    <li>The "Math" Object reminds me a lot of the work I did for phsycis classes and a special chemistry class </li>
    <li>JSON, almost forgot what that was. Haven't used API's in a while. That'll probably change. Don't like how you can't put comments in json files.</li>
    <li>Man, they went into deep detail with "Math Object" section. Even included trigonometry. (Been forever since I've touched that too)</li>
    <li><b>I want to do a bit of tinkering with the "ReExp" object stuff! (pg 202 start)</b> Skimmed over it slightly in WDD 230. It's kind of confusing, but I guess with some experimenting would be helpful.</li>
    <h4>Chapter 6 Notes</h4>
    <li>Loved the idea of creating a function for creating elements! Really DRYs things out.</li>
    <li>classList.toggle is supper useful!, so is the setAttribute function, style properties, etc.</li>
    <li>Want to try the getComputedStyle() function, though it's basically the same thing as inspecting the page and checking the element.</li>
    <h4>Chapter 7 Notes</h4>
    <li>Only one event handler for each event-type can be attached to an HTML element</li>
    <li>mousedown = click and hold, mouseup = release, click - down and up! Cool!</li>
    <li>dblclick! </li>
    <li>"it is important to distinguish
      between a physical key on the keyboard and a character that appears on the
      screen. The keydown event is the action of pressing a key, whereas the keypress
      event is the action of a character being typed on the screen"</li>
    <li>"It’s important to support mouse events as well as touch events, so non-touch
      devices are also supported. With so many different devices these days, you can’t
      rely on users using just touch or a mouse."</li>
    <li>"Each of these keyboard events have an key property that returns the printed
      representation of the key that was pressed, if it has one."</li>
      <li>"if a user touches the screen with two fingers,
        events.touches.length would return 2. The first touch object can be accessed
        using events.touches[0] and the second using events.touches[1]."</li>
        <li>This is all AMAZING!</li>
        <li>With preventDefault(), stopPropagation(), and other stuff, you can probably mess people over big time</li>
        <li>They don't go into much detail in terms of the <em>target</em> attribute in event listeners. They can be really handy though.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've been working a lot with the DOM since I started a year ago, do I have to do the Ninja Practice at the end of the chapters?</p>
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I have to do the Quiz Ninja projects at the end?</li>
    <li>I want to make a game using event listeners!</li>
    <li>What was the Browswer War?</li>
    <li>The Example on page 278, I don't really understnad the difference in the capturing and bubblin code. They both basically say the same thing.</li>
