    <h1>Notes (ERIK Q. Birch)</h1>
    <h3>Chapter 8</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
      <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
      <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
      <li>Strict Mode! as if things couldn't get more strict enough when it comes to coding. But this is actually pretty fascinating! I might apply it and see what happens</li>
      <li>EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URLError, InternalError</li>
      <li>This weeks readings was pretty short</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stuff to dig deeper into</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>toThrow()/throw()</li>
      <li>toBe()</li>
      <li>jest -c {}</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Why do we have the debugger command when we can just click left of the line numbers and make a red dot that stops the code? (I guess its'because not all code had the red dot luxury back then).</li>
    </ul>
