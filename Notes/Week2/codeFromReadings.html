  <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>
  <h2>Notes from Readings</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of neat tricks in the text. 
    <ul>
      <li>the spread operator, '...', to include everything in arrays and sets</li>
      <li>Ternary Operators/ if...else statements, 
        <br>(condition) ? (//code to run if condition is true) : (//code to run if condition is false)</li>
      <li>Understanding when to use arrow functions. (I prefer normal function declarations because of their hoisting properties, but understanding arrow funcitons is also good)</li>
      <li>Understanding the difference between Parameters and Arguments</li>
      <li>Rest operatiors, '...', and default parameters </li>
    </ul>
    A lot of things brought to rememberance as well: map(), for...of..., DRY's meaning, etc. 
    </p>
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <p>
    Not a lot of questions. Most of this was kind of review for me. 
    <ul>
    <li>I wanted to know how to run my code in my VSCode terminal rather than attaching it to an html file. I think it has to do with npm stuff.
      Is that what I need to use in order to run code on my VSCode termianl?
    </li>
  </ul></p>
