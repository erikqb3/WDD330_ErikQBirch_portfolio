  <h2>Notes from Readings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>There are lots of ways to create objects.</li>
    <li>The "Math" Object reminds me a lot of the work I did for phsycis classes and a special chemistry class </li>
    <li>JSON, almost forgot what that was. Haven't used API's in a while. That'll probably change. Don't like how you can't put comments in json files.</li>
    <li>Man, they went into deep detail with "Math Object" section. Even included trigonometry. (Been forever since I've touched that too)</li>
    <li><b>I want to do a bit of tinkering with the "ReExp" object stuff! (pg 202 start)</b> Skimmed over it slightly in WDD 230. It's kind of confusing, but I guess with some experimenting would be helpful.</li>
